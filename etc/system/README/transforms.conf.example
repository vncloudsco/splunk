#
# The following stanza converts that single event into multiple metrics at
# index-time. It blacklists the "dc_latitude" and "dc_longitude" dimensions,
# which means they are omitted from the generated metric data points. It also
# whitelists the "name" and "dc_latitude" dimensions, which means that those
# dimensions potentially are the only dimensions that appear in the
# generated metric data points. However, when a log-to-metrics configuration
# simultaneously includes a BLACKLIST and a WHITELIST, only the dimensions that
# appear in the WHITELIST and that do not appear in the BLACKLIST are included
# in the generated metric data points. In this case, "dc_latitude" appears in
# the BLACKLIST and the WHITELIST, so it is not included in the generated
# metric data points. The metric data points generated by this configuration
# have "name" as their sole dimension.
