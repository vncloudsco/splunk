# Splunk -- It's tasty.
#

# NOTE!!! starting in Splunk 3.2, this is just a convenience script useful for
# setting the environment variables splunk uses into your local shell.  You
# can no longer change SPLUNK_HOME or SPLUNK_DB settings here -- see
# ../etc/splunk-launch.conf instead

# We need to find the "splunk" binary which is in the same directory as this
# script.  Unfortunately there's no portable way of finding what path we're
# being sourced from.  However, bash puts our exact command in $BASH_SOURCE
# and zsh puts it in $0, so check for those here.  If you're running a
# different shell we'll have to assume that $SPLUNK_HOME is already set
# properly
